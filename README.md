This is a forked project of [waveshare-clock](https://github.com/prehensile/waveshare-clock) that only displayed clock and weather and supported only Waveshare 4.2inch B&W displays.
This project enhances the original project to support Waveshare 2.7inch displays with red dye (BWR) and adds the following additional features:
- gauges for current traffic drive times for two configured destinations (thanks to [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/))
- gauge for air quality index (AQI) of home location (thanks to [Airly.eu API](http://developer.airly.eu/) or [World Air Quality Index API](https://aqicn.org))
- weather gauge can display:
  - current temperature + weather status icon plus forecast: daily min/max temperatures (thanks to [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org) & [Weatherbit.io](https://weatherbit.io))
  - alerts issued by EU countries (thanks to *[meteoalarm](https://meteoalarm.org)* - limited support for EU countries i.e. where ATOM feed is available)
- buttons support to display detailed information about: weather, air quality, traffic and system information (on supported devices, i.e. 2.7inch HUT with switches)
- font with relaxed license already included in the project

For both new gauges one may configure warning levels - in such a case the particular gauge becomes red (on supported devices, i.e. 2.7inch BWR).

*BTW, these LEGO bricks are almost 30 years old (!)*


## Hardware Requirements

- [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://botland.com.pl/moduly-i-zestawy-raspberry-pi-zero/9749-raspberry-pi-zero-wh-512mb-ram-wifi-bt-41-ze-zlaczami.html) or similar
- [e-paper display 2.7inch HUT](https://botland.com.pl/wyswietlacze-e-paper/9656-waveshare-e-paper-hat-b-27-264x176px-modul-z-wyswietlaczem-trojkolorowym-nakladka-do-raspberry-pi.html) or e-paper display 4.2inch B&W display with SPI
- 8-16GB SD card

## Installation

- install [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) on SD card using [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) instruction
- enable and configure WiFi before you start the system - more [here](https://howchoo.com/g/ndy1zte2yjn/how-to-set-up-wifi-on-your-raspberry-pi-without-ethernet)
- enable ssh (but be [careful](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-security-update-for-raspbian-pixel/) - don't expose ssh port to internet, or change the password ASAP) - on SD card create ```ssh``` file, it can be empty (for example ```touch /Volumes/boot/ssh```)
- find the IP of RPi by scanning your local network or take a look at your router to find a new device connected to your network
- SSH to your raspberry: ```ssh pi@10.20.30.40```
- Python 3 should be already present, you may want to verify this by running: ```python3 --version```
- check if SPI (required by display) is enabled: ```sudo raspi-config```
- install git: ```sudo apt install git```
- install python pip: ```sudo apt install python3-pip```
- install the following packages as they might be required by Pillow: 
  - libopenjp2-7: ```apt-get install libopenjp2-7```
  - libtiff5: ```apt-get install libtiff5```
- on Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye you may need to do the following:
  - set `gpio` group for `/dev/gpiomem`:
    ```sudo chgrp gpio /dev/gpiomem && sudo chmod g+rw /dev/gpiomem```
  - add `gpio` group to user:
    ```sudo adduser USER gpio```
- issue the command to fetch this project:
    ```git clone https://github.com/pskowronek/epaper-clock-and-more.git```
- go to the project directory: ```cd epaper-clock-and-more``` and install required python modules:
  ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
  - if it fails then please try to analyze any error statements and follow instructions if provided
  - the most common issue is Pillow's requirement regarding libjpeg - if it is the case then invoke ```sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev ``` and retry pip3 install
  - before you report a bug, try to google it first :)
- rename run-EDIT-ME.sh to run.sh and edit run.sh to configure:
  - your home location (lon & lat)
  - two destinations to check traffic delays
  - a key for traffic information from Google Maps - you can get it [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key) *)
    - it is wise to read Google Maps [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)
    - tl;dr: basically you have to enable Route API - follow [these](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes/get-api-key) instructions,
      then you have to enable billing for it - just go [there](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) - they won't charge you if you are below the limits (set a threshold warning to be sure)
  - a key for weather forecasts from OpenWeather - you can get it [here](https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up) or *)
    - [One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) is being used to replace DarkSky provider
    - 2024.04 update: since One Call 2.5 access close(d) in June 2024, now 3.0 is being used. This requires a separate subscription to Open Call 3.0 (free tier, but billing data required) - see [here](https://openweathermap.org/one-call-transfer)
  - a key for weather forecasts from Weatherbit.io - you can get it [here](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create) *)
    - alternative weather forecasts provider
  - a key for Air Quality Index data from Airly.eu - you can get it [here](https://developer.airly.eu/register) *)
    - alternatively you can use World Air Quality Index API - you can get it [here](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/) *)
    - WAQI (aqicn.org) works as a fallback if you don't specify any token for Airly
  - by configuring *meteoalarm* related settings, weather forecasts can be supplemented with alerts originating from *[meteoalarm.org](https://meteoalarm.org)* site
    - limited to EU countries that have ATOM feeds on above page (a limitation of [meteoalarmapi](https://pypi.org/project/meteoalertapi/) library)
    - there might be issues (no readings) if chosen province name contains diacritic characters - **to be investigated**
  - type of e-paper device, whether it is 2.7 or 4.2 (by default it is pre-configured for 2.7" BWR)
  - tweak additional settings to:
    - prefer local temperature readings as served by Airly instead of weather provider(s)
    - display warnings using black font instead of white on red canvas (more readable if red dye faded out)
    - switch 2.7 BWR into BW
    - turn off displaying hours & minutes separator
    - enable/disable debug mode, buttons etc
- run the script: ```./run.sh``` (hit Ctrl-C to exit) and verify if it works as expected
- install this project as a service so it could automatically run when Raspberry boots up (more details [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/systemd.md))
  - copy epaper.service to /etc/systemd/system: ```sudo cp epaper.service /etc/systemd/system/``` **)
  - verify if service works by invoking the following command: ```sudo systemctl start epaper.service```
  - enable this script so it could be run on system start: ```sudo systemctl enable epaper.service```
  - reboot device to verify if it works
  - if you needed to modify epaper.service issue this command: ```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```
  - logs can be observed in /var/log/syslog: ```sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep run.sh```
- recommended system change in case of network outage (see [#18](/../../issues/18))
  - add the following line to `/etc/resolv.conf`: `options timeout:2 attempts:1` (only 1 attempt for resolving names with 2s timeout)


*) By default data are being fetched every 10+ minutes so they should comply with developer free accounts limitations

**) If your project directory is different than /home/pi/epaper-clock-and-more then you must edit this file to reflect the correct path

## Tech details

### 2.7inch & 4.2inch support

Since the original project supported 4.2inch B&W displays only, the code has been modified to support also 2.7inch B+W+R displays. This has been done by adding a second red canvas and down-sizing the black and red canvases to smaller resolutions as required by 2.7inch displays.

### 2.7inch display refresh

E-paper 2.7inch by Waveshare does not support partial refresh and every modification of displayed data requires full refresh which takes around 5s meantime flickering a lot.

### 2.7inch display refresh made faster

You may try to turn on experimental feature to make display refresh much faster (10x quicker for black dye, 2-3 times quicker for red dye).
This has been achieved by modification of LUT tables of original ```epd2in7b.py``` Waveshare library. The LUT tables are used by the display
to create "waveforms" that refresh every pixel. This of course has negative consequences - the refresh isn't perfect (but still okey) and
artifacts may build-up with time. To recover the display you would need to turn off this feature and run the project for a while using original LUT tables.
To see how the tables were modified issue this command: ```diff epd2in7b.py epd2in7b_fast_lut.py```

The idea of modifying the LUT tables has been described [here](http://benkrasnow.blogspot.com/2017/10/fast-partial-refresh-on-42-e-paper.html) for 4.2" displays.
Since I don't have 4.2" display I didn't try to provide similar feature for it.

To enable this feature set the following environment variable: ```export EPAPER_FAST_REFRESH=true```


## TODOs

- rework drawing.py (~~make it a class~~ and gagues rendered w/o knowledge about their final placement)

## License

Since this project is a fork, the original licenses still apply. The modifications and enhancements are being done under Apache 2 license and MIT (dual licence).
